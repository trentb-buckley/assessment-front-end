		<h1>About</h1>

		<p>
			I enjoy the outdoors and try to be outside as much as possible.
			I like making wood crafts like pens, furniture and toys. I haven't had a lot of time to myself lately but when I am established in my career I will have more freedom to devote to my hobbies. <img class="ace" src="ace-photo.jpg"
